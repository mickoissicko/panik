<p align="center">
  A cool program that closes a certain process, window, or application (manually set) whenever a certain keystroke is detected, or an array of keys are pressed in a specific order. (I know whatcha doin... üòè)
</p>

# Shoddy code?
Yes. Very shoddy; trash code. I wrote this program months ago. I'm reviving it just now. And no, I'm not going to fix hundreds of lines of code. No, no.

It pains me as well.

# Instructions (POSIX)
Download and run the binary with superuser privileges. Here's how:

`$ sudo ./panik`

Enter the event number. You can get it by:

`$ sudo pacman -Sy evtest`
`$ sudo evtest`

Find your keyboard, and enter that in.

Then, it asks for a Keycode. Refer to `KEYCODES.txt` or scroll down for the list.

After, enter in a process name, e.g. `plasma-systemmonitor` or `firefox.bin`.
